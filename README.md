# Operational Close Validator

Early validation system for detecting unsupported, unauthorized, or inconsistent operational events before operational close and submission to accounting.

## Problem

Operational closes frequently require manual rework because missing receipts, informal authorizations, or inconsistent records are detected only during final consolidation or after submission to accounting.

## MVP objective

Demonstrate that a registered operational event without the required evidence can be detected before close, generate a blocking alert, and prevent the close from advancing until the inconsistency is corrected and successfully revalidated.

## MVP workflow

1. Register an operational event.
2. Execute fixed business validations.
3. Generate a blocking alert when required evidence is missing.
4. Correct the cause of the alert.
5. Revalidate the event.
6. Consolidate the operational close.
7. Submit the validated close to accounting.

## Included event types

- Income
- Expense
- Discount
